#Sorting 

### [Bubble sort](https://github.com/Hrishi2520/JavaProblems/tree/main/Sorting/BubbleSort/src)
- Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. 
- This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.
